# ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-for-Developers-Course
Welcome to the "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" course repository!

ðŸ¤– About the Course: This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developers interested in mastering the art of prompt engineering for ChatGPT. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey into natural language processing, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to create effective and engaging conversational AI experiences. Using the OpenAI API, youâ€™ll be able to quickly build capabilities that learn to innovate and create value in ways that were cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible before now.

This short course taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:

1.) Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)

2.) Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)

3.) Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)

4.) Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)

In addition, youâ€™ll learn two key principles for writing effective prompts, how to systematically engineer good prompts, and also learn to build a custom chatbot.

All concepts are illustrated with numerous examples, which you can play with directly in our Jupyter notebook environment to get hands-on experience with prompt engineering.

ðŸ“š What's Inside: Inside this repository, you'll find a treasure trove of valuable content, including:

Course Materials: Access the course lectures, slides, and hands-on exercises that cover a wide range of topics related to prompt engineering, from understanding the fundamentals to advanced techniques.

Code Samples: Dive into practical code examples and templates that demonstrate how to interact with ChatGPT's API, optimize prompts, and integrate the model into your applications.
